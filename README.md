# My personal Neovim config

This repository contains my personal neovim config, written from scratch. I
learned a lot from the [Awesome Neovim
Configuration](https://github.com/Ultra-Code/awesome-neovim), along with other
sources from all over the internet.

The most important plugins that are used in this config and on which I am
relying every day are:
- Telescope
- Treesitter
- LSP config (+ Mason and friends)

A lot of the other plugins are nice to have. Some should probably by pruned, as
they are not used anymore or could be replaced easily.
